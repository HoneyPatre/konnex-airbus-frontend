> The project, ‚ÄúCadbury Assistance‚Äù is a Hackthon Project, for AIRBUS Aerothon 3.0, consisting of a Assistive-Touch-Button feature injected into static Airbus homepage UI for users to have features like bug report, improvements, announcements, navigation, information and speech recognizer. My contribution in this project has been towards client side frontend creation i.e. assistive-touch-button, including pop ups, tables and redirections. Apart from this, I have implemented Speech Recognition feature which performs redirection using voice.
